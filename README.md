## Project Description: 
We merged covid (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Daily-Chicago-COVID-19-Cases-Deaths-and-Hospitaliz/kxzd-kd6a) and crime (https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/dataset/crime.html) data sets based on date and we plotted crime and covid cases for each day or each week from March 2020 to January 2021 to see if there is any relationship between covid cases and crime.

**A:** We see higher R squared value of 0.2251 in these graphs, but this still shows a very weak associated between domestic crimes and covid cases.
